In this project, I helped design and implement a control system that maintains the balance of a wheeled inverted pendulum and corrects for angular disturbance.

For this project, we used a Pololu Balboa 32U4 robot kit as the robotic base with a set of 0.6 m long laser-cut MDF side extension to raise the center of mass and create the inverted pendulum. At the top of the robot are a set of weights, adding up to around 200g.

Here is a video demonstration of our our robot in action. Once the robot is rotated up to a standing position, it is able to balance by itself. It can balance even with external distrubances such as light shoves and taps as seen in the video.
