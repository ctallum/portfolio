I worked as a robotics intern at Honda Development and Manufacturing of America, specifically at the Alabama Automotive Plant. While at Honda, I worked within the Weld 1 department where Honda vehicles are assembled and welded using several hundred Fanuc robots.

During my internship, I had the oportunity to see how robotic systems are used within the industrial and automotive industry. A few of the projects I worked on during my internship are the following:

1. Install and train a vision system on a Fanuc spot-weld robot to assist in pick and place operations. This vision system is currently in use and helps reduce mispicks. This system reduces assembly line downtime, reduces cost, and reduces human injury.

2. Install and train a vision system to gather data on a Fanuc pick and place robot. This data was used to help identify potential problems with the assembly line. The data is currently being used to develop countermeasures for inconsistant robot operations.
