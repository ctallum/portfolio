While at Markforged, I worked as a software intern working to design the user interface and functionality of the new FX20 printers. While on the team, I worked on the following:

- I worked on some internal benchmarking and stress testing tools
- Internal software optimizations that reduced print file processing time by around 7x. For large multiday prints on the FX20, this could save several minutes of processing time.
- Wrote lots of logging functionality for the new firmware on the FX20 to help developers understand the current state of the machine and to make debugging and finding errors easier
- I worked primarily in Typescript and a tiny bit with Rust

To give you an idea of the stuff I was working on, here is a photo of the FX20 printer that I was working with.
