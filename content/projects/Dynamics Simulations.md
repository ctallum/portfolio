This is a collection of problem sets and my simulated results from my Olin 2021 Dynamics Class.

## Problem Set 1

### 1. Golf Ball Simulation (Air Resistance)

#### Setup
For this problem, a golf ball, with diameter D and mass m, is launched from point p with an initial velocity vector V<sub>0</sub>=v<sub>x<sub>0</sub></sub>i + v<sub>y<sub>0</sub></sub>j + v<sub>z<sub>0</sub></sub>k. The wind is blowing with air velocity V<sub>w</sub>=W<sub>x</sub>i+W<sub>y</sub>j+W<sub>z</sub>k resulting in a drag force, F<sub>D</sub>, acting on te ball. The drag force acts in the direction opposite its velocity and it proportional to the square of the velocity.

### 2. Two Mass Hopper Simulation

#### Setup
For this problem, two masses, m<sub>upper</sub> and m<sub>lower</sub>, are connected by a linear spring with an unstreched length, L<sub>0</sub>, and a spring constant, K. The upper mass is given an initial downward displacement and is then released, resulting in the hopper jumping.

## Problem Set 2

### 1. Marble in a Bowl Simulation

#### Setup
For this problem, a small marble is released at the rim of a hemispherical bowl of radius R = 200 mm with an initial velocity of 100 mm/s in the circumferential direction. The marble slides on the inside surface of the bowl without friction. Gravity acts in the downward vertical direction.

### 2. Rollercoaster Simulation

#### Setup
For this problem, a roller coaster cart is released along a roller coaster track.  the track is defined by the function, y=h(1-B\*xL)cos<sup>2</sup>(3πx/(2L)) where 0<B<1 controls the height of the second peak of the track. One design constraint is that the cart must always travel over the second peak. 
The cart has air resistance. The magnitude of the force is F<sub>D</sub>=1/2ρC<sub>D</sub>V<sup>2</sup> where ρ is the air dentisty and C<sub>D</sub> is the drag coefficient, A is the frontal area of the car (which has mass, m), and V is the magnitude of the velocity of the car. The direction of the drag force is opposite to that of the car's velocity.

![Rollercoaster Problem Setup](/Images/setup/rollercoaster.png)

#### Results

For a rollercoaster with the following characteristics and initial conditions:
- Initial height of ride: 100 m
- Horizontal length of the ride: 500 m
- Mass of car: 500 kg
- Frontal area of car: 4.0 m<sup>2</sup>
- Drag coefficient: 0.1
- Air density: 1.02 kg/m<sup>3</sup>

![Rollercoaster simulation results](/Images/results/Rollercoaster-results1.png)

B = 0.361 is the lower bound for how tall the second peak can be. For any value B lower than 0.361 results in a second peak that is too tall for the rollercoaster cart to go over.

These two simulations were calculated using different coordinate systems. The cartesian pendulum was calculated with equations of motion that were defined using a cartesion coordinate system, while the polar pendulum was calculated with equaitons of motion that were defined using a polar coordinate system. As expected, the two are identical. Both coordinate systems describe a pendulum accurately.

Adding viscious drag and aerodynamic drag to the pendulum result in the following. Viscous drag is proportional to the angular velocity of the pendulum while aerodynamic drag is proportional to the square of the angular velocity.

## Final Project

### Double Pendulum on a Cart
For this problem, a planar double pendulum consisting of masses, m<sub>2</sub> and m<sub>3</sub>, are suspended by massless rods of length l<sub>1</sub> and l<sub>2</sub> with a frictionless pivot upon a frictionless lateral cart with mass, m<sub>1</sub>. The position of the cart can be described by the distance x with respect to the origin, and the positions of the pendulums can be described by the angles, θ<sub>1</sub> and θ<sub>2</sub>, with respect to vertical. Gravity acts in the downward vertical directions. Furthermore, the cart and pendulum masses are subject to a drag force F<sub>D</sub>=C<sub>D</sub>V<sup>2</sup> where C<sub>D</sub> is the drag coefficient and the force is acting in the oposite direction of velocity.
