I can't really say too much about what I did at Markforged as a Software Intern due to me signining a non-disclosure agreement, but here is what I can say:

- I had the oportunity to work on the middleware that exists on the new FX20 printers
- I worked on some internal benchmarking tools
- I helped work on a new piece of software that reduces print processing time by around 7x
- I wrote some logging tools print file processing
- I worked primarily in Typescript and a tiny bit with Rust

To give you an idea of the stuff I was working on, here is a photo of the FX20 printer that I was working with.
