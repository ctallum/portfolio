### Summary
- Created a custom 3d printer slicer that takes any 3d model and slices it into a set of paths that are optimized for fiber inlays.
- Each layer is a single stroke and non self-intersecting
- Custom infill geometry (square, triangle, or hexagon) and infill density

### Context
Inspired by the following research paper:

- A novel single-stroke path planning algorithm for 3D printers using continuous carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics - Yamamoto et al.
- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214860422002160
