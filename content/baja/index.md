### Overview

I was a member of Olin's Baja SAE team for four years. The team worked on designing a new off-road vehicle each year in preparation for an end of year competition. For three years, I served as the head of the suspension sub-team, leading the design and fabrication of the suspension, steering, cockpit, and brakes. In effect, our sub-team designed and fabricated any component on the car that wasn't the main chassis or the engine, gearbox, and transmission. 

Through Olin's Baja team, I became proficient in mechanical design, FEA analysis, and machining. I have also learned a lot about suspension geometry and cars in general.

Part of my duties as the suspension team lead were organizing and leading team meetings, keeping track of deadlines, fostering a collaborative and friendly workspace, and mentoring younger teammates on design and fabrication. 

### By the numbers
- 50+ custom designed vehicle components
- 300+ hours in the machine shop
- 100+ parts machined (Lathe, Mill, CNC Mill, Welded)

### Projects I have worked on for both design and fabrication
- front steering knuckles
- front wheel hubs
- half shaft spline adapters
- upper and lower a-arms
- tie rod 
- front spherical bearing mounts
- half shaft - differential oil seals
- front suspension layout and geometry
- brake pedal design
- gas pedal design
- specifying front brakes
- front brake mounts
- specifying rear brakes
- rear brake mounts
- rear trailing arms and bearing carrier
- rear control arms
