For my class EK505: Introduction to Robotics, for our final project, my team designed an obstacle avoidance system for warehouse robots. Typical warehouse robots use LiDAR to detect obstacles and the environment around them. However, this leaves them prone to small pieces of debris such as broken pallet chunks that are often found in warehouses. Robots can slip on them and whatever they are carrying may be damaged if the robot falls. To solve this problem, our group explored using an overhead RGB camera to detect obstacles. We are using an image segmentation system to identify and isolate obstacles from the ground. We then use a CLF-CBF formulation for path planning to avoid the obstacle.
