#### Weekly Log
I'm keeping a weekly log of things that I got done and things that I learned as well as any interesting results.

#### June 3 - 7
- For this week, I mainly spent time getting familiar with the project background as well as getting onboarded with everything. I installed Ubuntu 18.04 and ROS Melodic on my laptop and spent time going through all the ROS tutorials to get familiar with the platform.

#### June 10-14
- For this week, I continued going through the ROS tutorials, specifically for Gazebo and the Clearpath Jackal robots. I also had to fix some issues with ROS and Ubuntu and how they interacted with broken dependencies on my laptop. I also read though old project code to get a better sense of how everything works on a base level.
